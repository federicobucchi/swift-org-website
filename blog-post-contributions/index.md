The [Swift.org blog](https://www.swift.org/blog/) helps to keep the Swift community informed of recent developments in the language, the release roadmap, interesting new features, libraries, tools, and announcing project & community initiatives. It is central to Diversity in Swift’s mission to recognize and highlight work across the community. We welcome blog post contributions from everyone, regardless of background or experience.

Are you doing interesting things using Swift? The community would love to hear how you’ve been using the language. See the process below for details on how to submit a blog post.

## Community Contributed Content

Blog posts don’t necessarily need to be technical, and your writing can appeal to anyone from beginners to language experts. Did you have an unusual journey towards Swift? Share that story. Did you use Swift code to interact with some hardware or in another context that people might not expect? That sounds great. Is there a previously covered topic you’d like to take further? Adding your experience and perspective is valuable.

Readers have different backgrounds and experiences, but you can assume a basic knowledge of the Swift language.

Is there anything to avoid in a Swift.org blog post? There’s a short list:

* Directly commercial content promoting a product, service, or event.
* Launch announcements for apps or libraries. While a blog post could talk about a new Swift language library or package, it should not be the post’s focus. The [Community Showcase](https://forums.swift.org/c/community-showcase/66) section of the Swift forums is ideal for community announcements.

## Writing Guidelines

Blog posts on Swift.org don’t need to be written in a particular style, but there are some guidelines below that will help make a great post:

* Write inclusively and respectfully according to the Swift.org Code of Conduct.
* There’s no set length for a blog post, but between 500 and 1,000 words is typical.
* Screenshots, illustrations, code snippets, and links to documentation or other websites can be worth a thousand words.
* You can write alone or in a small group. It’s up to you.

## Submission Process

Submit ideas or drafts of blog posts by [sending a message to the @swift-website-workgroup](https://forums.swift.org/new-message?groupname=swift-website-workgroup&title=Blog%20post%20proposal). Be sure to include some details about what you’d like to contribute in your post:

* Either a first draft or a few paragraphs that summarise your post idea.
* Whether your post or the topic it covers is time-sensitive and any information on why.
* Your name and Swift forum username. If you are writing as a group, include everyone.

The [Swift Website Workgroup]({% link website-workgroup/index.md %}) discusses blog post pitches bi-weekly and will reply to all submissions.

Like all contributions to this website, the [Swift.org website governance]({% link website-governance/index.md %}) process covers all blog post submissions.
