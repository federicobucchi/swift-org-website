Anyone with a good idea can help shape the future features and direction of the language.
To reach the best possible solution to a problem,
we discuss and iterate on ideas in a
[public forum](/community/#swift-evolution).
Once a proposal is refined and approved,
it becomes a release goal,
and is tracked as a feature of an upcoming version of Swift.

To support this process,
the [Swift Evolution repository](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution)
collects the goals for the upcoming major and minor releases
(as defined by the [core team](/community/#core-team))
as well as proposals for changes to Swift.
The [Swift evolution process](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/process.md) document details how ideas are
proposed, discussed, reviewed, and eventually accepted into upcoming releases.

Below is a list of all the current and upcoming proposal reviews.
